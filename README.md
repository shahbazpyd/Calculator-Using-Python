# Python Calculator Projects

This repository contains two simple calculator projects I built as a beginner in Python: a console-based calculator and a desktop-based calculator using Tkinter.  These projects helped me practice fundamental Python concepts and explore different UI approaches.

## Console-Based Calculator

This calculator runs in the command line and performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). It uses functions to organize the code and a loop to allow multiple calculations.

**Key Learnings:**

* Working with functions and function calls.
* Using loops (specifically `while` loops) for repeated execution.
* Handling user input and validating input types.
* Basic arithmetic operations in Python.
* Implementing a simple menu-driven interface.


## Desktop-Based Calculator (Tkinter)

This calculator provides a graphical user interface built with Tkinter. It supports the same basic arithmetic operations as the console version.

**Key Learnings:**

* Building a graphical user interface with Tkinter.
* Using widgets like buttons, entry fields, and labels.
* Handling button clicks and events.
* Laying out widgets using the grid system.
* Integrating functionality with the UI elements.
* A basic understanding of event-driven programming.

## Future Improvements

* **Error Handling:** Implement more robust error handling, such as catching division by zero errors and invalid input.
* **More Operations:** Add more advanced mathematical functions (e.g., square root, powers, trigonometric functions).
* **UI Enhancements (Tkinter Version):** Improve the UI design and add features like a backspace button.
* **Unit Testing:** Add unit tests to ensure code correctness and reliability.

## Getting Started

To run the console calculator, simply execute the `console_calculator.py` file.

To run the desktop calculator, ensure you have Tkinter installed and then execute `desktop_calculator.py`.


## Conclusion

These projects were a fun and educational way to get more comfortable with Python. I'm excited to continue developing my programming skills and exploring more complex projects in the future.
